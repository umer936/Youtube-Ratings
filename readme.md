#YouTube Ratings for Sidebar 

So I was browsing old GitHub projects and I found one that added the ratings to the sidebar of YouTube. 

I forked it and got to work to bring it up to date from it's "last updated in 2012" version. 

After rewriting what Git tells me is 98% of the code, I finished it. 

Posible TODO if demand, 
- Show the actual likes/dislikes numbers underneath 
- Show like/dislike images 
- Customizations of locations options
